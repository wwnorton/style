Nicole Sullivan's OOCSS wikiSmashing Magazine's Introduction to OOCSS BEM, or “Block-Element-Modifier”, is a naming convention for classes in HTML and CSS. It was originally developed by Yandex with large codebases and scalability in mind, and can serve as a solid set of guidelines for implementing OOCSS. CSS Trick's BEM 101Harry Roberts' introduction to BEM We recommend a variant of BEM with PascalCased “blocks”, which works particularly well when combined with components (e.g. React). Underscores and dashes are still used for modifiers and children.

For example, ReservationCard.jsx should have a reference name of ReservationCard. However, for root components of a directory, use index.jsx as the filename and use the directory name as the component name: // bad import Footer from './Footer/Footer'; // bad import Footer from './Footer/index'; // good import Footer from './Footer'; Copy Higher-order Component Naming: Use a composite of the higher-order component’s name and the passed-in component’s name as the displayName on the generated component. For example, the higher-order component withFoo(), when passed a component Bar should produce a component with a displayName of withFoo(Bar). Why? A component’s displayName may be used by developer tools or in error messages, and having a value that clearly expresses this relationship helps people understand what is happening. // bad export default function withFoo(WrappedComponent) { return function WithFoo(props) { return &lt;WrappedComponent {...props} foo /&gt;; } } // good export default function withFoo(WrappedComponent) { function WithFoo(props) { return &lt;WrappedComponent {...props} foo /&gt;; } const wrappedComponentName = WrappedComponent.displayName || WrappedComponent.name || 'Component'; WithFoo.displayName = `withFoo(${wrappedComponentName})`; return WithFoo; } Copy Props Naming: Avoid using DOM component prop names for different purposes. Why? People expect props like style and className to mean one specific thing.

Inconsistencies between keyboard shortcuts and keyboard commands used by people using screenreaders and keyboards complicate accessibility. // bad &lt;div accessKey=&quot;h&quot; /&gt; // good &lt;div /&gt; Copy Avoid using an array index as key prop, prefer a stable ID. eslint: react/no-array-index-key Why? Not using a stable ID is an anti-pattern because it can negatively impact performance and cause issues with component state. We don’t recommend using indexes for keys if the order of items may change. // bad {todos.map((todo, index) =&gt; &lt;Todo {...todo} key={index} /&gt; )} // good {todos.map(todo =&gt; ( &lt;Todo {...todo} key={todo.id} /&gt; ))} Copy Always define explicit defaultProps for all non-required props. Why? propTypes are a form of documentation, and providing defaultProps means the reader of your code doesn’t have to assume as much. In addition, it can mean that your code can omit certain type checks. // bad function SFC({ foo, bar, children }) { return &lt;div&gt;{foo}{bar}{children}&lt;/div&gt;; } SFC.propTypes = { foo: PropTypes.number.isRequired, bar: PropTypes.string, children: PropTypes.node, }; // good function SFC({ foo, bar, children }) { return &lt;div&gt;{foo}{bar}{children}&lt;/div&gt;; } SFC.propTypes = { foo: PropTypes.number.isRequired, bar: PropTypes.string, children: PropTypes.node, }; SFC.defaultProps = { bar: '', children: null, }; Copy Use spread props sparingly. Why? Otherwise you’re more likely to pass unnecessary props down to components. And for React v15.6.1 and older, you could pass invalid HTML attributes to the DOM. Exceptions: HOCs that proxy down props and hoist propTypes function HOC(WrappedComponent) { return class Proxy extends React.Component { Proxy.propTypes = { text: PropTypes.string, isLoading: PropTypes.bool }; render() { return &lt;WrappedComponent {...this.props} /&gt; } } } Copy Spreading objects with known, explicit props. This can be particularly useful when testing React components with Mocha’s beforeEach construct. export default function Foo { const props = { text: '', isPublished: false } return (&lt;div {...props} /&gt;); } Copy Notes for use: Filter out unnecessary props when possible. Also, use prop-types-exact to help prevent bugs. // bad render() { const { irrelevantProp, ...relevantProps } = this.props; return &lt;WrappedComponent {...this.props} /&gt; } // good render() { const { irrelevantProp, ...relevantProps } = this.props; return &lt;WrappedComponent {...relevantProps} /&gt; } Copy "},{"title":"Refs​","type":1,"pageTitle":"React Style Guide","url":"docs/react#refs","content":"Always use ref callbacks. eslint: react/no-string-refs // bad &lt;Foo ref=&quot;myRef&quot; /&gt; // good &lt;Foo ref={(ref) =&gt; { this.myRef = ref; }} /&gt; Copy "},{"title":"Parentheses​","type":1,"pageTitle":"React Style Guide","url":"docs/react#parentheses","content":"Wrap JSX tags in parentheses when they span more than one line. eslint: react/jsx-wrap-multilines // bad render() { return &lt;MyComponent variant=&quot;long body&quot; foo=&quot;bar&quot;&gt; &lt;MyChild /&gt; &lt;/MyComponent&gt;; } // good render() { return ( &lt;MyComponent variant=&quot;long body&quot; foo=&quot;bar&quot;&gt; &lt;MyChild /&gt; &lt;/MyComponent&gt; ); } // good, when single line render() { const body = &lt;div&gt;hello&lt;/div&gt;; return &lt;MyComponent&gt;{body}&lt;/MyComponent&gt;; } Copy "},{"title":"Tags​","type":1,"pageTitle":"React Style Guide","url":"docs/react#tags","content":"Always self-close tags that have no children. eslint: react/self-closing-comp // bad &lt;Foo variant=&quot;stuff&quot;&gt;&lt;/Foo&gt; // good &lt;Foo variant=&quot;stuff&quot; /&gt; Copy If your component has multiline properties, close its tag on a new line. eslint: react/jsx-closing-bracket-location // bad &lt;Foo bar=&quot;bar&quot; baz=&quot;baz&quot; /&gt; // good &lt;Foo bar=&quot;bar&quot; baz=&quot;baz&quot; /&gt; Copy "},{"title":"Methods​","type":1,"pageTitle":"React Style Guide","url":"docs/react#methods","content":"Use arrow functions to close over local variables. It is handy when you need to pass additional data to an event handler. Although, make sure they do not massively hurt performance, in particular when passed to custom components that might be PureComponents, because they will trigger a possibly needless rerender every time. function ItemList(props) { return ( &lt;ul&gt; {props.items.map((item, index) =&gt; ( &lt;Item key={item.key} onClick={(event) =&gt; { doSomethingWith(event, item.name, index); }} /&gt; ))} &lt;/ul&gt; ); } Copy Bind event handlers for the render method in the constructor. eslint: react/jsx-no-bind Why? A bind call in the render path creates a brand new function on every single render. Do not use arrow functions in class fields, because it makes them challenging to test and debug, and can negatively impact performance, and because conceptually, class fields are for data, not logic. // bad class extends React.Component { onClickDiv() { // do stuff } render() { return &lt;div onClick={this.onClickDiv.bind(this)} /&gt;; } } // very bad class extends React.Component { onClickDiv = () =&gt; { // do stuff } render() { return &lt;div onClick={this.onClickDiv} /&gt; } } // good class extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); this.onClickDiv = this.onClickDiv.bind(this); } onClickDiv() { // do stuff } render() { return &lt;div onClick={this.onClickDiv} /&gt;; } } Copy Do not use underscore prefix for internal methods of a React component. Why? Underscore prefixes are sometimes used as a convention in other languages to denote privacy. But, unlike those languages, there is no native support for privacy in JavaScript, everything is public. Regardless of your intentions, adding underscore prefixes to your properties does not actually make them private, and any property (underscore-prefixed or not) should be treated as being public.

This is because the variable is hoisted. let and const solve this problem since they aren’t hoisted. Therefore, we should use let or const variables. This way, if we reference those variables, we’ll get an error. // Bad 👎 var hoisted; console.log(hoisted); // will be undefined; // Good 👍 let notHoisted; const alsoNotHoisted; console.log(notHoisted); // Will throw an error (which is what we want in this case); console.log(alsoNotHoisted); // Will also throw an error (which is what we want in this case); Copy Replace Magic Numbers with Named Constants @typescript-eslint/prefer-as-const If we have numbers that are used as constants repeatedly but aren’t assigned to a constant, then we should assign it to one.
