> A [commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org) [shareable config](https://commitlint.io/docs/en/configuration.html#sharing-configurations) for [Norton code style](https://gitlab.com/wwnorton/style).

## Usage

When using npm v7+, you just need to install this package and its peer dependencies will also be installed.
Older versions of npm will need to manage peer dependencies differently or update npm.

```sh
npm install --save-dev commitlint-config-norton
```

Once installed, refer to [the commitlint setup guide](https://commitlint.js.org/#/guides-local-setup) to start using the config in your application.

> **Note**: [the commitlint setup guide](https://commitlint.js.org/#/guides-local-setup) refers to `@commitlint/config-conventional`. Replace that with `commitlint-config-norton` to set up this config.
